Theme: Running out of space

6x6 grid - you have to try to fit in all the given pieces into the grid, as you
slowly run out of space! like RushHour but instead of being given the car to
escape you have to fill the parking spaces up.

The world is running out of space - play god and try to keep the population under
control.

survivalist game where the base is running out of space to support the population
- go and make space for them to grow.

fighting on a platform that gets increasingly smaller.

Bloxorz like game where the times are removed once you have been on them - try to
remove the tiles and finish on the safe square, while you eliminate your space to
move. Can use diffrent shapes ect.
